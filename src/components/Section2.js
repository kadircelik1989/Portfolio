            Since embarking on my career as a web developer 18 months ago, I
            have been dedicated to honing my skills in this field. After gaining
            initial experience as a freelance web developer for 6 months, I
            realized the importance of further professional development. To
            enhance my expertise to a professional level, I successfully
            completed a coding bootcamp. Currently, I am enthusiastically
            seeking a position where I can work in an office environment and
            collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals. I am eager to
            contribute my skills and continue growing as a web developer through
            collective efforts.
